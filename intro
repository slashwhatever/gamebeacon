First, some good news; I've worked out a way to show you all the app I've been developing on both Android and iOS! YAY!

You have to jump through a couple of hoops though.

1. You'll need to sign up for a free Ionic account here: https://apps.ionic.io/signup
2. Once you've got an account, you'll need to download the Ionic View app to your mobile device: http://view.ionic.io/
3. PM me the email address you signed up with in Step 1 and I will invite you into the app Beta programme.
4. Accept the invite when it arrives in your inbox.
5. Sign in to the Ionic View app on your mobile device using the credentials you used in Step 1 and you will see the app in Ionic View
6. Click the app to launch it!

You should then be able to play with the app to your heart's content.

Bear in mind that this initial test is purely about working out the very basic things, such as:
- Were you able to sign up easily?
- Do the basic functions of the app work on your device?
- Did the app work smoothly and without any weird glitches or crashes?

Once the basic alpha test is done, I'll roll it out to a wider audience in a more official build so I can start to test how the app behaves under the stress of many more users.

There are a ton more features I have lined up for the app already but your feedback is hugely important. Feel free to message me or email me (gamebeacon@slashwhatever.com) with your ideas, feedback and criticism - please keep it constructive :)
