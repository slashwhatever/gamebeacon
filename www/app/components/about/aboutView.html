<h1 class="text-center">FAQ</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Q: Is the app free?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Yes. It will remain free as long as we can afford the server costs :)</p></li>
<li><p>Q: How can you afford to have a free app?</p></li>
<li><p>A: We can't. There's a donate button at the bottom of this page and in the action menu. If you find the app useful and want to support the ongoing development costs, please consider donating a few beans.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Is there a benefit to donating?</p></li>
<li><p>A: not right now. You just get that warm fuzzy feeling knowing you helped keep something alive for the greater good. We may build in donator-only features later, depending on feedback and we may ask donators if they'd like their name features in a special "Credits" page at a later date.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Are you going to sell my data to pay the bills?</p></li>
<li><p>A: No. We hate spam as much as you. We will never give, sell or otherwise pass your data to anyone else. Ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: So why do you need my email address?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Email verification helps keep the app secure. It also means if we need to contact you about an issue with the app, we have a way of doing so.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Will there be a version for iOS?</p></li>
<li><p>A: We hope so. Development costs time and money. We're working on it but we need your help to develop the app further.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Is the app finished?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Hell no! We've got a ton of extra features on the road map and will look to enable them as soon as we can.
